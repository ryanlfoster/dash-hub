**DashHub**
A super simple way to show the latest GitHub stats for any GitHub Repo. I wanted a dashboard I could throw up on a big monitor and see today's progress in real time. Think you can improve it? Go ahead send a pull request.

**Notes**
DashHub uses GitHubs public API which means you're limited to 60 requests per hour. DashHub ping GitHub every 60 seconds. If you want to add OAuth support in order to increase your request limit feel feel to fork and submit a pull request.
